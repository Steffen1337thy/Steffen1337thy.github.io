						<h2> <strong> Facts about me!</strong>
						<br />
						</h2>
						<p> I am a 34 year old guy from Germany, blessed with a wonderful wife and two wonderful children.
						<br />
							In my free time I force them to go hiking or playing boardgames with me. Most time they like it.
						<br />
							But I am also blessed with good friends who are like me, loving to spend hours and hours with heavy strategic boardgames,
						<br />
							enjoying a good discussion about the import and lesser important things of life. Or watching all Lord of the rings movies in a row.
						<br />
							I love good stories, no matter if book, series or movie. It is the novelty and the mysterious that inspires me.
						<br />
							But it is also the pure emotion I love when cheering for my teams in the Bundesliga and the NFL.

										<h2><strong>My Data Science Journey!</strong>
										<br />
										Where it began - where it will go...</h2>
									</header>

						<p> <strong> Phase 1 - Starting my career! </strong> I started as a bank advisor. But at any point I discovered that I was more interested in finding
						<br />
						general approaches to sell specific products to target groups than in individual selling processes with customers.
						<br />
						I had a good feeling about small-talk topics as indicators of needs for different products.
						<br />
						I also built some simple calculation and visualization tools that improved my closing efficiency.
						<br />
						So I quit my job to study and find a job that requires more analytical and strategical thinking.
						<br />
						<br />
							<strong> Phase 2 - Studying </strong> I made my bachelor in Economics. During my studies I discovered my love for math, statistics and computer science.
						<br />
						While I worked as Tutor for math and statistics, I underestimated my talent in programming.
						<br />
						The computer science course lasted two semesters and focused on sql and vba.
						<br />
						It was very easy but I thought I am just good "for an economist" in it. I don't know yet, why the field
						<br />
						of data science never came up to me. After my bachelor I started my Master in Sales Management.
						<br />
						The Master program was limited for 15 students per semester and I wanted to get more specialized.
						<br />
						Luckily for me, a lot of the courses had a focus on statistics and so I got into work with several analytical tools like MPlus and SPSS.
						<br />
						<br />
						<strong> Phase 3 - First Job after study! </strong> As mentioned before I wanted to work on more analytical and strategic topics.
						<br />
							So after finishing my Master I joined the Sales Coordination & Business Development Department of tkre.
						<br />
							I worked on several topics in the fields of MI, BI and Business Development and Pricing.
						<br />
							Due to my affinity to Statistics and Programming I got full control of the Sales BI.
						<br />
							As I searched for possibilities to scale up methods and skills of statistical analysis for greater
						<br />
							data I discovered the field of data science. So my taught myself
						<br />
						<br />
						<strong> Phase 4 - Getting deeper into data! </strong> Since I found out about the wide field of data science I jumped
						<br />
							fully into it. Due to my studies I had a strong foundation in statistics. So I started with teaching myself python
						<br />
							and getting a stronger knowledge in computer science.
						<br />
							I started with the cs50 course on edx.org. This was really fun and challenging. After building up
						<br />
							more knowledge with the help of udemy (I can really recommend xy if you are german speaker) and youtube
						<br />
							I started to integrate programming in my daily working business.
						<br />
							Building pipelines, cleaning data, finding duplicates across different tables I was able to
						<br />
							integrate programming in my daily business.
						<br />
							To further improve my skills I worked myself through different literature (especially O'Reilly) ,
						<br />
							my daily reading feed on medium and started my micromaster in Data Science via MITx. I already finished half of the courses.
						<br />
						<br />
						<strong> Phase 5 - What's next? </strong> The next thing is projects, projects and more projects.
						<br />
						The best way to improve from this point is in working on projects. And it is also the goal. To make cool stuff with data :-)
