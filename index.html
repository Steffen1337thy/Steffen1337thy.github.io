						<h2> <strong> Facts about me!</strong>
						<br />
						</h2>
						<p> I am a 34 year old guy from Germany, blessed with a wonderful wife and two wonderful children.
						<br />
							In my free time I force them to go hiking or playing boardgames with me. Most time they like it.
						<br />
							But I am also blessed with good friends who are like me, loving to spend hours and hours with heavy strategic boardgames,
						<br />
							enjoying a good discussion about the import and lesser important things of life. Or watching all Lord of the rings movies in a row.
						<br />
							I love good stories, no matter if book, series or movie. It is the novelty and the mysterious that inspires me.
						<br />
							But it is also the pure emotion I love when cheering for my teams in the Bundesliga and the NFL.

										<h2><strong>My Data Science Journey!</strong>
										<br />
										Where it began - where it will go...</h2>
									</header>

						<p> <strong> Phase 1 - Starting my career! </strong>
							<br />
								I started as a bank advisor. But soon I discovered that I was more interested in finding
							<br />
								general trends and approaches to sell specific products to target groups.
							<br />
								I became very good in identifying customer needs from buzzwords in small-talk topics.
							<br />
								I also built some simple calculation and visualization tools that automatized the process
							<br />
								and improved closing efficiency.
							<br />
								So I decided to quit my job to study and find a job where I could work more on an
							<br />
							 	analytical and strategical level.
							<br />
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 2 - Studying </strong>
							<br />
							I made my bachelor in Economics. During my studies I discovered my love for math, statistics
							<br />
							and computer science.
							<br />
							While I worked as Tutor for math and statistics, I underestimated my talent in programming.
							<br />
							The computer science course lasted two semesters and focused on SQL and VBA.
							<br />
							The stuff was quite easy for me but I thought I am "just good for an economist" in it.
							<br />
							I don't even know today, why the field
							<br />
							of data science never came up to me that days. So I would probably started to focus on that
							<br />
							earlier.
							<br />
							After my bachelor I started my Master in Sales Management.
							<br />
							The Master program was limited for 15 students per semester and I wanted to get more specialized.
							<br />
							I focused on statistic-heavy courses and taught myself statistic tools like MPlus and SPSS.
							<br />
							By the end of my Master I had to decide between getting into Industry or remain at the
							<br />
							university for my PH.D..
							<br />
							My theoretical skills were way better than my practical skills so I decided to go working.
							<br />
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 3 - First Job after study! </strong>
							<br />
							As mentioned before I wanted to work on a more analytical and strategic level.
							<br />
							So I joined the Sales Coordination & Business Development Department of tkre.
							<br />
							I worked on several topics in the fields of <strong> MI, BI and Business Development and
							<br />
								Pricing. </strong>
							<br />
							Due to my affinity to Statistics and Programming I got full control of the Sales BI-Topics.
							<br />
							As I searched for possibilities to scale up methods and skills of statistical analysis
							<br />
							for greater data I discovered the field of data science - and instantly knew that this was
							<br />
							what I was always looking for.
							<br />
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 4 - Getting deeper into data! </strong>
							<br />
							Since I found out about the wide field of data science I fully jumped into it.
							<br />
							Due to my studies I had a strong foundation in statistics. So I started with
							<br />
							teaching myself python and achieving a stronger knowledge in computer science.
							<br />
							I started with the cs50 course on edx.org. This was really fun and challenging. After building up
							<br />
							more knowledge with the help of udemy (I can really recommend Jannis Seemann if you are
							<br />
							german speaker) and youtube. I started to integrate programming in my daily working business
							<br />
							by building pipelines, cleaning data, and finding duplicates across different tables.
							<br />
							The more I used my new skills and daily business the more my colleagues requested my skills
							<br />
							to help them for different automatization and analytic-tasks.
							<br />
							To improve my skills further I worked myself through different literature (especially O'Reilly) ,
							<br />
							my daily reading feed on medium and started the <strong> MicroMaster-program in Data Science via MITx </strong>.
							<br />
							I recently finished the second of four courses.
							<br />
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 5 - What's next? </strong>
							<br />
							The next step is working on projects, projects, projects.
							<br />
							The best way for me to improve from this point is to work on practical implementations.
							<br />
							And it is also the reason, why I started this Journey.<strong> To create cool stuff with data :-) </strong>
