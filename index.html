										<h2><strong>My Data Science Journey!</strong>
										<br />
										Where it began - where it will go...</h2>
									</header>
								<div>

						<p> <strong> Phase 1 - Starting my career! </strong>
							</p>
								<p>
								After school leaving examination, I started my career as a bank advisor.
								</p>
								<p>
								Early I got the responsibility for a small branch.
								</p>
								<p>
								I liked the time, but soon I discovered that I was more interested in finding
								</p>
								<p>
								general trends and approaches to sell specific products to special target groups.
								</p>
								<p>
								I became very good in recognizing customer needs from buzzwords in small-talk topics and
								</p>
								<p>
								generalizing best practices to greater target groups.
								</p>
								<p>
								I also built some simple calculation and visualization tools that automatized processes
								</p>
								<p>
								and improved closing efficiency.
								</p>
								<p>
								One example: A lot of customers wanted to park their money on their current account
								</p>
								<p>
								without interest until the interest rates go up. So I built a calculator that show, how
								</p>
								<p>
								much interest rate needs to improve to additionally compensate the parking time.
								</p>
								<p>
								The only question left to ask was: "Do you think such an improvement is realistic?"
								</p>
								<p>
								So I decided to quit my job to study and find a job where I could work more on an
								</p>
								<p>
								such an analytical and/or strategical level.
								</p>
								<p>
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 2 - Studying Bachelor & Master </strong>
								<p>
									Due to my banking background, I made my bachelor in Economics. During my studies I really
								</p>
								<p>
									made myself aware of my love for math, statistics and computer science.
								</p>
								<p>
									While I worked as tutor for math and statistics, I was very confident in my abilities.
								</p>
								<p>
									On the other hand I underestimated my talent in programming.
								</p>
								<p>
									The computer science course lasted two semesters and focused on SQL and VBA.
								</p>
								<p>
									The stuff was quite easy for me but I thought I am "just good for an economist" in it.
								</p>
								<p>
									I don't even know today, why the field of data science never came up to me that days.
								</p>
								<p>
									So I would have probably started to focus on that career path earlier.
								</p>
								<p>
									Instead, after my bachelor I started my Master in Sales Management at the RUB.
								</p>
								<p>
									The masters program sounded very attractive at it was limited for around 15 students per semester
								</p>
								<p>
									and I wanted to get more specialized.
								</p>
								<p>

							I focused on statistic-heavy courses and taught myself statistic tools like MPlus and SPSS.
						</p>
								<p>
							By the end of my Master I had to decide between getting into Industry or remain at the
						</p>
								<p>

							university for my PH.D.. I considered my theoretical skills way better than my practical skills
						</p>
								<p>

							so I decided to go working and built up practical experience.
						</p>


							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 3 - First Job after study! </strong>
						<p>
							As mentioned before I wanted to work on a more analytical and strategic level.

						</p>
						<p>
							So I joined the Sales Coordination & Business Development Department of tkre.
						</p>
						<p>
							I worked on several topics in the fields of <strong> MI, BI and Business Development and Pricing. </strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Due to my affinity to statistics and programming I got full control of the Sales BI-Topics.
						</p>
						<p>
							As I searched for possibilities to scale up methods and skills of statistical analysis
						</p>
						<p>
							for greater data I discovered the field of data science - and instantly knew that this was
						</p>
						<p>
							what I was always looking for - jobwise.
						</p>
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 4 - Getting deeper into data! </strong>
							<p>
							Since I found out about the wide field of data science I fully jumped into it.
								</p>
						<p>
							Due to my studies I had a strong foundation in statistics. So I started with
						</p>
						<p>
							teaching myself python and achieving a stronger knowledge in computer science.
						</p>
						<p>
							I started with the cs50 course of Harvardx on edx.org. This was really fun and challenging.
							</p>
						<p>
							Afterwards I worked through different courses on udemy and youtube.
							</p>
						<p>
							I also started to integrate programming in my daily working business
				</p>
						<p>
							by building pipelines, cleaning data, and finding duplicates across different tables.
		</p>
						<p>
							The more I used my new skills and daily business the more my colleagues requested my skills
								</p>
						<p>
							to help them for different automatization tasks and analyses. Also I learned SQL and PowerBI.
								</p>
						<p>
							To further improve my skills I worked myself through different literature (especially O'Reilly),
							</p>
						<p>
							my daily reading feed on medium and started the <strong> MicroMaster-program in Data Science via MITx </strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							I recently finished the second of four courses.
						</p>
							<br />
							<br />

							<strong> Phase 5 - What's next? </strong>
				<p>
							The next step is working on projects, projects, projects.
						</p>
						<p>
							The best way for me to improve from this point is to work on practical implementations.
					</p>
						<p>
							And it is finally the reason, why I started this Journey.
					</p>
						<p>
							<strong> To create cool stuff from data :-) </strong>
